Design an intelligent system to recognize mahjong tiles in a picture and determine whether they are winning

In the second semester of my freshman year, I took a course titled "Numerical Methods: Principles, Algorithms and Applications". Driven by my curiosity, I chose this project as the major assignment for this course. I had never been exposed to such an "intelligent" project before and didn't even know that this was a classic problem in the field of computer vision. Fortunately, I managed to initially complete this project within a relatively limited time, although it was rather rough and rudimentary. But I think it was this rather interesting problem that led me into the world of computer vision.
After that, I began to study computer vision comprehensively and deeply. On the one hand, it is to optimize my project; on the other hand, it is also out of interest.

This repository contains the evolutionary history of this project, and I have been trying to optimize and adjust it bit by bit. Due to the lack of a large dataset, the results may not be very satisfactory.

In any case, I am eager to further explore the world of computer vision!
